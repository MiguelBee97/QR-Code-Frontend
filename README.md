## Overview

Initially I started this project with a little bit of trouble because the HTML element did not take the whole viewport height. I didn't realise this for a bit of time, but once I got that locked down I was able to easily center the container. Everything after that was fairly simple styling using the Figma designs. Moving forward I'll likely "eyeball" dimensions first then reference the designs to confirm/adust.
